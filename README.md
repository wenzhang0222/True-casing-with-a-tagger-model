# True-casing with a tagger model
This repository is an exercise inspired by the [CUNY Computational Linguistics Winter Camp](https://github.com/CUNY-CL/winter-camp), with data and ideas sourced from the CUNY GC Computational Linguistics Lab.

## Project Overview
The project explores the NLP task of true-casing, also known as case restoration. True-casing aims to restore appropriate capitalization in text, which is especially useful for improving readability in outputs from machine translation, speech recognition, and noisy user-generated content like social media posts.

## Learning Goals
Through this exercise:
- Understand how true-casing can enhance readability in various NLP applications.
- Build a case restoration system using Python and command-line tools.
- Practice Python skills in file handling, command-line integration, and structured classification using a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model.

## Tasks and Structure
- Case Restoration: Develop a model that tags words with appropriate case patterns.
- Data and Feature Extraction: Utilize structured classification techniques for true-casing.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Use provided English data or acquire additional sources to train and test the model.
