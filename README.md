# True-casing_with_a_tagger_model
This GitHub page serves as an exercise inspired by content from the [CUNY Computational Linguistics Winter Camp](https://github.com/CUNY-CL/winter-camp). The initial data and idea come from the CUNY GC Computational Linguistics Lab.

# Project Overview
##The project explores the NLP task of true-casing, also known as case restoration. True-casing aims to restore appropriate capitalization in text, which is especially useful for improving readability in outputs from machine translation, speech recognition, and noisy user-generated content like social media posts.

# Learning Goals
## Through this exercise, you will:
## Understand how true-casing can enhance readability in various NLP applications.
Build a case restoration system using Python and command-line tools.
Practice Python skills in file handling, command-line integration, and structured classification using a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model.

# Prerequisites
##Proficiency in Python, including familiarity with lists, dictionaries, functions, file handling, and basic command-line usage.
No prior knowledge of Conditional Random Field models is required, but reviewing this technology could be beneficial.

# Tasks and Structure
## Case Restoration: Develop a model that tags words with appropriate case patterns.
Data and Feature Extraction: Utilize structured classification techniques for true-casing.
Model Training and Evaluation: Use provided English data or acquire additional sources to train and test the model.
